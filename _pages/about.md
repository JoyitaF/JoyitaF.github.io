Hi! I'm Joyita Faruk. I'm a computer scientist and researcher. My main interests are in bioinformatics and quantum computing. 

I am presently affiliated with the Medical Imaging Research & Analytics wing in the IUB CCDS lab. Additionally, I am interning at Geval (genereveal) on genomics.

Aside from my publications, you can check out my upcoming research in the research section!
