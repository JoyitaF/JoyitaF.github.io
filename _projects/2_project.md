    The main goal of this study is the development of a hybrid cloud infrastructure that incorporates quantum computing techniques to increase the security and scalability of existing cloud systems.
    For this, we are exploring Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and quantum optimization algorithms.
    We were awarded the Mitacs Globalink Research Award for this project. 
    However, due to visa restrictions, we are continuing in Bangladesh.
